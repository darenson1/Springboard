Problem
Forecast Electrical Load based on Temperature Data
Client
Energy Distribution Company
Predictions can be used to optimize energy production 
Data
2012 Global Energy Forecasting Competition Data from Kaggle
Methodology
Data exploration, wrangling, and model construction will be done in python
Associate temperature stations with energy distribution zones
This can be accomplished by finding the station that produces the minimum error on the test data per zone
Regression models will be built for each of 20 subsystems (zones)
The subsystem models will be combined to form predictions at the system level
Deliverables
Python code
Cleaning
Exploration
Model Construction
